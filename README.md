# Electric-Vehicle-Sales-Forecasting
The aim of the project is to apply the different machine learning techniques on the dataset which is obtained from the international energy agency, to accurately predict electric vehicle (EV)  sales and demand in the upcoming years.

The project.ipynb file consists the code for preprocessing and EDA.

AutoRegressive, ARIMA, Linear regression and LSTM algorithms were used to do the time series prediction.

A UI is created using Tkinter to forecast the sales globaly and country wise.
